  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
  # The Capitains Dev environment uses Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit 
  # We use 32 bit instead of 64 bit because some systems require BIOS
  # switch flipping to enable virtualization of 64 bit OS
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty32"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine.

  # Capitains Dev Defaults are set here
  # but can be changed if they conflict with apps you are already
  # runnig locally. In that case, keep the guest ports as configured
  # but change the ports that they map to on the host.  This way
  # all setup scripts for the Capitains Dev Vagrant box will continue
  # to work.

  # For example, if you already have somehing you run on port 8080
  # on your machine, then you might change this line:
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080
  # to:
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8081
  # which would then make eXist from the Vagrant box available 
  # to you at http://localhost:8081

  # 5000 will be the default port for Nautilus
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5000, host: 5000

  # 8100 will be the default port for Nemo
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8100, host: 8100

  # 8080 will be the default port for eXistDB
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Capitains Dev Environment users need to change these to point to the 
  # location of any CTS texts repositories that you want to work with
  # from your local machine. They should point at the root directory 
  # of your local clone of the corresponding GitHub repository.

  # For example if you have these cloned in /Users/JohnSmith/Documents
  # on your local machine you would use
  #
  # config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/JohnSmith/Documents/canonical-latinLit", "/vagrant_data/latinLit" # config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/JohnSmith/Documents/canonical-greekLit", "/vagrant_data/greekLit"
  # this makes it possible for the Vagrant Box to read the textual data
  # directly from your local machine
  config.vm.synced_folder "/home/user/canonical-latinLit", "/vagrant_data/latinLit"
  config.vm.synced_folder "/home/user/canonical-greekLit", "/vagrant_data/greekLit"


  # this just sets the name of the Vagrant host. Don't change.
  config.vm.define :CapitainsDevExist do |t|
  end

   config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

  # Uncomment the following line if you want to 
  # display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
  #   vb.gui = true

  # You may want to increase the the amount of memory on the VM
  # set to to the number of bytes of RAM you want the box to 
  # be allowed to consume from your local machine
     vb.memory = "1024"

   # The network card defaults for Vagrant to do not work for all
   # machines.  This was needed for working with my Ubuntu Lenovo Laptop
   # It may not be necessary or other values  might be needed on other OS
   # and hardware configurations
